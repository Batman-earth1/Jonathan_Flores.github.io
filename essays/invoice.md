On my experience per my last wod , the INVOICE 1 . I would have to say that the wod is not as hard as the others. Alot of the base code for the table is found by inspecting the page as per the instructions as well as chatgpt halping out. The screen cast is helpful as well ,a although the profffessor used shortcuts that I was not aware to make this faster and I went back and forth trying tofigure out what was working and what wasnt. I did not get the expected outcome for the table and in my experience was not ideal. This requires some practice and testing that as of late has not been afforded to me becasue of the scheudle of things in my life. I now realize the balance I must take for all my classes and not devote so much time for all.
