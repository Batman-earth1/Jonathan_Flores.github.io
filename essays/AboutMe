*About me.*

Hi, I'm Jonathan! Originally from Mission Viejo, California, I currently reside in Oahu. I hold an associates degree in business management from Saddleback College with hopes to obtain my B.S. from University of Hawaii @ Manoa in M.I.S. I majored in Managment information systems because it seemed relevant to todays leading innovations, that could allow me to have the best work-life balance I would want in my life.
I'm passionate about sports,videogames,film and raving! ;) 
I look forward to meeting you!:)
Mahalo!!!
