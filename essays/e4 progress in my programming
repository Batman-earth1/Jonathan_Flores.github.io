My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
In researching and asking for help. In recalling ideas. In understanding how to use chatgpt effectivly. In noticing what parts of my code I need to change when errors occure

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
  Actually knowing how to change the errors that occur and using the right code.
  understandning the application even more (vscode) and shortcuts.
I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
   I have learned from the wods, however I do not think I can do them without the screencasts , at least fully.
The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
  The labs have helped me learn but the pace is never consistent and the directions are often confusing and difficult to grasp at times.
I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
  I have learned alot from assignment one often from asking for help from other peers and learning from my mistakes in a trial by fire sort of way of learning.
I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
   More T.A's or tutors. Chargers in the class, more time after class to interact with the proffessor, I'm a really slow learner so sometimes when I lag behind the rest of the class its really hard to catch up but thats just me personally.
What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
  What helps me most in class is the screencasts, recordings from class, external readings and websites, youtube, former students helping me understand the concepts , one on one help and other classmates.
